# The motion detection in fswebcam is enabled when one or more zones
# are added to the config file. A captured image is saved only if a
# pixel in the zone(s) differs by more than a certain amount from the 
# last captured image. Image zones are compared in greyscale the
# difference can range from 0 to 255. 
# Here the zone is (x=0, y=0, w=640, h=480) and maximum difference 50.
